# Model Comparison for California Housing Price Prediction

This repository contains **Task-2 of the AI/ML Internship**, where multiple regression models are implemented and compared to predict house prices using the California Housing dataset.

## Objective
The goal of this task is to build an enhanced house price prediction system by:
- Applying feature scaling
- Training multiple regression models
- Comparing model performance using standard evaluation metrics
- Selecting the best model with proper justification

## Dataset
- **Dataset:** California Housing Dataset (Scikit-learn)
- **Target Variable:** Median House Value
- **Features:** Median Income, House Age, Average Rooms, Population, and location-based attributes

## Models Implemented
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor

## Evaluation Metrics
Each model is evaluated using:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score

## Results
The models are compared in a structured manner, and the **best-performing model is selected based on evaluation metrics**, primarily the R² score and RMSE.

## Visualization
An **Actual vs Predicted** scatter plot is used to visually assess the performance of the selected best model.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Conclusion
This task demonstrates how different regression models perform on the same dataset and highlights the importance of model comparison and evaluation in machine learning workflows.
